# Wedding Website Readme
This project involves a wedding website created with Flask as the backend web framework, along with PostGreSQL/MySQL (haven't picked which one yet, depends on how I deploy) and primary CSS/HTML as the frontend design with BootStrap involved. 

The requirements file has everything needed to get started with the Python installation packages, necessary ones such as Django and psycopg2.

The layout will be mainly a bootstrap free template that has a dynamic scrolling effect.
