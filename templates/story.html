							<p class="begin">Our story begins when we first met in 2013 at a SMU/UNT football game in Denton, Texas. 
							Our mutual friend Joe invited us to the game and I agreed to come hang out. 
							My roommate at the time had to leave the game early so I didn't spend a ton of time talking to Summer then. 
							However, there would be plenty of chances for us to get to know each other in the future, largely thanks to Joe!

			<p class="Scotland">June 2018, we got to visit Scotland together! Some of the places we got to check out are Edinburgh (we stayed there a majority of the time), Inverness and Glasgow. 
			Additionally, we got to have a nice day out on the beach of Portobello beach. We also got to see the Killers concert in Glasgow! This was my first experience outside of the country in Great Britain,
			thus opening my eyes to another culture entirely. If you haven't had the chance to check out another country,
			I highly suggest Scotland becoming one of the first. The countryside is remarkable and the cities have such
		    grand structures that even predate the United States.</p>
